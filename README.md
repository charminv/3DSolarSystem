# Planet Playbook

This project aims to create an interactive solar system using p5.js for a school assignment. Our goal was to go beyond the traditional static representation and introduce an exciting free roam feature, allowing users to explore the solar system at their own pace.

## Features

* **Solar System Visualization:** Utilizing p5.js, we have crafted a visually appealing representation of the solar system, including the sun, planets, and their respective orbits.
* **Next Planet and Previous Planet Buttons:** Users can easily navigate between planets using the "Next Planet" and "Previous Planet" buttons. This allows them to explore each celestial body in sequential order.
* **Free Roam Feature:** The free roam feature provides users with the freedom to explore the solar system at their own pace. They can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, and drag the screen to move around.
* **Exit Free Roam Button:** Users can exit the free roam mode by clicking the "Exit Free Roam" button, which returns them to the default view of the solar system.
